# Coding-Quiz

## Description

This challenge involved making a coding quiz that could be used as a way to review previously learned concepts. As the course goes on, more and more questions could be added to the quiz to continue reviewing what was taught.

I utilized HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a coding quiz that tests the user on previously learned concepts. It has a timer that increases whenever a question is answered correctly and decreases when it is answered incorrectly.

It also has the capability to store scores if the user chooses to do so.

I got to practice HTML, CSS and JS while making this quiz. I also learned how to utilze WEB-APIs to create this app that runs in the browser and stores the scores locally.
